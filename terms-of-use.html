                    <h1>TERMS OF USE</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to WeThink, LLC (“WeThink,” “we,” “us,” “our”) and thank you for using our products and services (“Services”). The following Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) govern all use of the Services, so please read carefully.</p>
                    <h3>1. ACCEPTANCE</h3>
                    <p>The Services on the WeThink Platform and other online and mobile services and applications belonging to WeThink are offered subject to your acceptance of these Terms, our Privacy Policy (located on our website) and any additional terms
                        and policies (including operating rules, guidelines and procedures) that may apply depending on your particular use of the Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>By using the Services or by clicking on an acceptance box for these Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and all other applicable terms and policies. YOUR USE OF THE ONLINE SERVICES IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED
                        UPON YOUR ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE. IF THESE TERMS OF USE ARE NOT COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR USE OF THE ONLINE SERVICES.</p>
                    <p>If you will be using the Services on behalf of a company or any other entity, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, “you” and “your” will refer to that
                        entity. Additionally, since the Services are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and take full responsibility for the selection and use of the
                        Services. These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p>ARBITRATION NOTICE: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
                        IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>
                    <h3>2. REGISTRATION</h3>
                    <p>In order to use certain features of the Services, you may be required to register for a Services account. You warrant that any registration information (such as name, contact information, or other information) you submit is accurate,
                        complete, and not misleading, and you agree to keep such information up to date. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of these Terms and may result in immediate termination of your account. To the extent you are able to select
                        a “user name,” you may not (i) select or use a user name that is a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use a user name that is a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without
                        appropriate authorization; or (iii) use a user name that is offensive, vulgar, obscene, or unlawful. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel or refuse registration of any user name we believe violates these Terms,
                        our policies, or the law. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and other account information. Your login must only be used by one person; a single login shared by multiple people is not
                        permitted. WeThink is not liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this Section 2. We may use your registration information and any technical information about your use of the Services to tailor its presentations
                        to you, facilitate your movement through the Services, communicate separately with you or publish the fact that you are a user of our services.</p>
                    <p>In order to verify your identity electronically, we will ask you for your details (such as your name, address, date of birth) and details of your identification documents. This information will be passed on to external organizations
                        in order to electronically match your information with information on their databases. These organizations will assess and advise us whether all or some of the information you provided matches their records.</p>
                    <p>The external data sources used to verify your identity include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Credit information files held by Equifax Pty Ltd or Creditorwatch Pty Ltd (this is only to confirm your identity and is not a credit check)</li>
                        <li>Publicly available information such as the electoral roll and white pages</li>
                        <li>Information held by the official record holder via third party systems</li>
                        <li>It is an offence under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to provide false and misleading information about your identity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>3. YOUR CONTENT</h3>

                    <h3>6. USE OF THE SERVICES</h3>

                    <h3>7. ACCOUNTS AND FEES</h3>
                    <p>To use our Services, you shall pay WeThink service fees in accordance with this Section 6 and our pricing policy located on our website (“Fees”). You will be billed for your first subscription term immediately upon registering. Subscriptions
                        will automatically renew for a period equal in length to the preceding subscription period. All Fees will be invoiced in advance (on a monthly or annual basis depending upon the subscription you purchase), and the credit card last
                        used by you for a WeThink transaction will automatically be charged at the start of each subscription period. All Fees are non-refundable—without limitation, we shall provide no refunds or credits for partial months of Service,
                        for upgrades or downgrades, or for unused months of an annual account. For any subscription upgrade, the credit card last used by you for a WeThink transaction will automatically be charged the new Fee on your next billing cycle.
                        We reserve the right to change the Fees and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of each subscription period. Unpaid Fees are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower,
                        plus all expenses of collection. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than taxes based on WeThink net income.</p>
                    <h3>8. CHANGES TO THE TERMS</h3>
                    <p>We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting an amended version in the Services and on our website. If you are a new or returning user who registers for services on or after the Notice Date, the amended version will be effective
                        immediately. If you are a current paying user of the Services, these Terms will continue under their original provisions for your original subscriptions, and the amended version will become effective at the start of your next WeThink
                        subscription period (including any new subscription or any automatically renewed subscription). Your use of the Services after an amended version becomes effective will confirm your acceptance and consent of that amended version.
                        It is your responsibility to check the Services or our website for amended versions of these Terms and to review any changes. These Terms may not be amended in any other way except through a written agreement executed by both you
                        and an authorized representative of WeThink. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may amend our Privacy Policy or all other auxiliary policies at any time by posting amended versions on our website; the amended versions will become
                        effective immediately upon posting.</p>
                    <h3>9. CHANGES TO SERVICES</h3>
                    <p>WeThink is constantly innovating and evolving the Services in order to provide the best possible experience for our users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without notice.
                        Changes to the form and nature of the Services may include, without limitation, the alteration or removal of a functionality or aspect of the Services. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
                        modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any part of the Services. You also agree that we may create limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts of the Services without notice or liability.</p>
                    <h3>10. ANTI-SPAM AND E-MAIL POLICY</h3>
                    <p>WeThink expressly forbids all SPAM (the term &quot;SPAM&quot; meaning the sending of unsolicited e- mail to parties unknown to the sender). If you are found to be using the Services for SPAM, your account will be subject to immediate
                        termination. The Services may only be used in connection with e-mail lists for which recipients have voluntarily registered. Using the Services to send e-mail to an address you obtain without the consent of the addressee is a violation
                        of these Terms. You are prohibited from importing e-mail addresses for persons who have not affirmatively and clearly elected to receive your mailings. For clarity, you will only send e-mail to persons who have willingly signed
                        up to receive your mailings. If we receive complaints about your activities under this Section, your account may be subject to immediate termination. You will not send e-mail under any company or organization name other than your
                        own company/organization, and you will not send e-mail with fraudulent or misleading header or source information. All e-mail sent through the Services must be expressly for the purpose of collecting data using WeThink’s online
                        surveys. Sending e-mail through the Services to solicit any actions other than completing WeThink surveys is a violation of these Terms. You are fully responsible for the contents of your messages and the consequences of any such
                        messages. We shall have no responsibility or liability for messages or other content that is created by you. You shall not send, post, distribute or disseminate any defamatory, obscene, or otherwise unlawful messages, material,
                        or information, including another person&#39;s proprietary information (including trademarks, trade secrets, or copyrighted information) without express authorization from the rights holder. WeThink will cooperate with legal authorities
                        in releasing names and IP addresses of users who are involved in SPAM or illegal activities.</p>
                    <h3>11. OTHER RESTRICTIONS</h3>
                    <p>WeThink shall not be subject to any obligations of confidentiality regarding any information or materials that you submit online except as specified in these Terms of Use, or as set forth in any additional terms and conditions relating

                        including, where permissible, to record the entirety of such calls regardless of whether WeThink asks you on any particular call for consent to record such call. You further acknowledge and agree that, to the extent permitted by
                        applicable law, any such recording(s) may be submitted as evidence in any legal proceeding in which WeThink is a party.</p>
