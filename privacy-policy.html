                    <p>WeThink recognizes that your privacy is very important, and we take it seriously. <br>This Privacy Policy applies to activities by WeThink and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “WeThink,” “we” or “us”).
                    </p>
                    <h3>OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT</h3>
                    <p>We are committed to respecting your (“you,” “your”) privacy rights and concerns. As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to inform you of how we use and protect the personal information we
                        collect from you (“Personal Information”) when you visit or create an account on the WeThink website platform (“WeThink Platform”).</p>
                    <p>When you create an account on the WeThink platform, we collect your name, contact information, demographic information, and other information you provide, such as topics that you know about or find interesting. Your name, photo, and
                        any other information that you choose to add to your public- facing profile will be available for viewing by the public and other users of the platform. Once you create a profile, others will be able to see in your profile certain
                        information about your activity on the platform, such as the questions and answers you post, your followers and who you follow, topics of interest to you, the information you list as credentials, and your edits to your content.</p>
                    <p>You can connect your existing WeThink account with certain third-party networks. You can also elect to sign in or sign up to the WeThink platform through a Linked Network (eg: Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) (“Linked Network”). If you elect
                        to sign up or connect through a Linked Network, we receive certain profile and account information about you from the Linked Network. These Linked Networks may also appear in your profile so that people can find you on these Linked
                        Networks. The specific information provided to us by the Linked Networks is determined by you and such Linked Networks and may vary by network. In all cases, the permissions page for the Linked Network will describe the information
                        being shared. You should consult their respective privacy policies for information about their practices. You may elect to use information from the Linked Network to populate your profile on the WeThink platform or to import your
                        contacts to help you find and connect with them on the WeThink platform or to invite them to join.</p>
                    <p>By visiting or using the WeThink Platform, you consent to our collection, use, storage, deletion, and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time
                        for any reason and without notice. Any modifications will take effect when posted. Therefore, each time you access the WeThink Platform, you need to review the Privacy Policy upon which access to and use of the WeThink Platform
                        is conditioned. By your continuing use of the WeThink Platform after changes are posted, you will be deemed to have accepted such changes. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the WeThink Platform and not to any other website
                        that you may be able to access from the WeThink Platform, which may have its own data collection and use policy.</p>

                        agreements.
                    </p>
                    <h3>SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS</h3>
                    <p>The WeThink Platform includes social media Features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, and Widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini- programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which

                        with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
                    <h3>PAYMENT</h3>
                    <p>If you make a purchase through the WeThink Platform, we may use a third- party payment processor such as Stripe or Paypal. Payments are encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction
                        data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction.</p>

                    <h3>THIRD PARTY SERVICES’ PRIVACY POLICIES</h3>
                    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us or to provide products and services to you. However,
                        certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related
                        transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
                    <p>Certain providers may be located in a different jurisdiction or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction, than either you or us. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party
                        service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed
                        by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
                    <p>Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>
                    <h3>LEGAL DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
                    <h3>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION; SIGNATURES</h3>
                    <p>You may withdraw your consent to receive communications by following the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our emails. You may withdraw your consent to use an electronic signature at any time by contacting us. If you withdraw your
                        consent, you will be unable to apply for products and services through the WeThink Platform, and we will be unable to continue to process any pending applications for products and services.</p>
                    <h3>HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SAFEGUARDED?</h3>
                    <p>While we strive to protect sensitive user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of the WeThink Platform, and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information
                        and engage in such transmissions at your own risk.</p>
                    <p>In the event that personal information you provide to us is compromised as a result of a breach of security, when appropriate we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation, notify you, and take the necessary steps to comply
                        with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                    <h3>MEDIATION</h3>
                    <p>You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you and we will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties. You agree that
                        if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in our state of domicile with a mutually
                        agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file any arbitration claims or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will
                        not be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.</p>

                <p>Residents of California may have the following rights:</p>
                <p>1. <u>Right to know and access your personal information.</u> Under CCPA, you have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Know the categories of personal information we collect and the categories of sources from which we got the information;</li>
                    <li>Know the business or commercial purposes for which we collect and share personal information;</li>
                    <li>Know the categories of third parties and other entities with whom we share personal information; and</li>
                    <li>Access the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To do so, please send a request to us and include your name, email address, phone number, California postal address, as well as your account information.
                </p>
                <p>2. <u> Right to deletion. </u>In some circumstances, you may ask us to delete your personal information. To do so, send us a request and include your name, email address, phone number, California postal address as well as your subscription
                    account number, if you have an active subscription.</p>
                <p>3. <u> Right to opt out of sales. </u>We may share your personal information with third parties in ways that may constitute a “sale” under CCPA. You may request that we not “sell” your personal information on a going forward basis. To
                    do so, either click the link “Do Not Sell My Personal Information, or send us a request and include your name, email address, phone number, California postal address as well as your member account number. <b><i>If you reengage
                        with us after opting out of the &quot;sale&quot; of your personal information, such as
                        by creating a new profile, you acknowledge that your personal information may be used and shared in accordance with this Privacy Notice, including
                        in ways that may constitute a &quot;sale&quot; under CCPA.</i></b></p>
                <p>4. <u>Right to be free from discrimination. </u>You may exercise any of the above rights without fear of being discriminated against. We are permitted to provide a different price or rate to you if the difference is directly related to
                    the value provided to you by your data. We use the information you provide to make your CCPA rights requests to verify your identity, locate the personal information we may hold about you and act upon your request. We strongly recommend
                    that you submit the email and postal address that you used when you created accounts, ordered subscriptions, or signed up for a newsletter. After you submit a CCPA rights request, you will be required to verify access to the email
                    address you submitted. You will receive an email with a follow-up link to complete your email verification process. You are required to verify your email in order for us to proceed with your CCPA rights request. Please check your spam
                    or junk folder in case you can&#39;t see the verification email in your inbox. If you are a California resident and have any questions regarding your CCPA rights under this Privacy Notice, please contact us.</p>
                <h3>Authorized Agents</h3>
                <p>For any of the CCPA rights, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In the request, you or your authorized agent must provide information sufficient for us to verify the identity of your agent and that your
                    agent has been properly authorized to act on your behalf; this may take additional time to fulfill your request. If you are an authorized agent working on behalf of a consumer, you will need to fill out the relevant CCPA request form
                    listed above on behalf of the consumer with the consumer’s information. Please note that the consumer you are working on behalf of must have a California postal address and will need to verify access to the email account used to submit
                    the CCPA request in order for us to move forward with processing the request.</p>
                <h3>Minors</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect or disclose personal information of minors under the age of 16, without affirmative authorization.</p>
                <h3>ADDITIONAL TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR EU CITIZENS</h3>
                <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU), EU citizens are entitled to certain privacy protections regarding the use of, storing, and processing of your personal information as well as having right
                    to be notified if personal information is stolen, copied, or accessed on an unauthorized basis.</p>
                <p>The GDPR is a modern privacy rights framework adopted to create better transparency and control over who, how and when your personal data may be used, including the “right to be forgotten”.</p>
                <p>This section will explain how We complies with the GDPR and how your personal data may be collected, stored, and used.  We also explain under what circumstances and for what purposes we may use your personal data and also provide instructions
                    on how you can “opt-out” from our using your personal data and also request the removal of your personal data from our systems.
                </p>
                <h3>OUR BUSINESS</h3>
                <p>We provide services to United States consumers and potentially United States businesses and share personally identifiable information with third parties. If you share your information with us, we may share it with third parties, including
                    sharing your information for other marketing purposes. Additionally, if you are an employee of or associated with a business customer, certain information may be considered personal data such as your business email, business mobile
                    number, or other similar information from which your personal identity may be known.  It is also customary in many instances for business associates to furnish their private or personal contact information such as private email address,
                    home telephone number, and similar information.  Even if done in the context of a business purpose, this information may be deemed personal data.  Therefore, if you believe your business information discloses personal data that you
                    do not wish disclosed, you should not give it to us.  You should also ask your employer to change your business contact information to an anonymized format, such as changing your email form “my.name@mycompany” to “randomcharacters@mycompany”.
                </p>
                <p>Please be advised that our business has less than 250 employees.  Accordingly, we are subject to less stringent recording requirements under GDPR requirements. We are, however, not exempt from other privacy protection and reporting requirements
                    which apply to all businesses equally.</p>
                <h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
